Using YUI on Grok
=================

In this tutorial you'll be learning how to use the Yahoo! User Interface Library, or YUI in short
in you Grok project. YUI is a JavaScript and CSS library providing all sorts of handy components
that you can use to make you site work an look better without too much effort, and in a 
cross-browser compatible way. More details on the YUI website [#]_

We will be using YUI 2.

The main packages that we will use are 
* hurry.yui which contains the YUI
* megrok.resource
but along the way, we'll also be using
* megrok.layout for the main layout
* megrok.navigation for the menus
* megrok.pagetemplate to override default templates
